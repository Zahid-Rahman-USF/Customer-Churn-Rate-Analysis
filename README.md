Customer Churn Analysis Project
Overview
This Jupyter notebook is part of a data analysis project aimed at exploring customer churn in the telecom industry. The analysis focuses on identifying key factors that contribute to churn and employing machine learning to predict churn likelihood among customers. This project leverages Python's data science ecosystem, including pandas, sklearn, and seaborn, to preprocess data, explore data patterns, and apply the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for prediction.

Contents
The notebook contains the following sections:

Data Loading: Importing the necessary Python libraries and loading the telecom churn dataset.
Data Cleaning: Checking for and addressing null values, duplicates, and outliers in the dataset.
Data Visualization: Using boxplots to visualize distributions and outliers in numerical columns.
Data Preprocessing: Scaling numerical features to prepare the data for machine learning.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Employing pairplots to explore relationships between features and select an appropriate machine learning algorithm.
Model Training and Evaluation: Splitting the data into training and testing sets, applying the KNN algorithm, and evaluating the model's performance.
Objectives
To understand the key factors that contribute to customer churn in the telecom sector.
To preprocess and clean the dataset to facilitate effective machine learning.
To explore the data and identify patterns that can inform the prediction model.
To apply and evaluate a KNN model to predict customer churn.
